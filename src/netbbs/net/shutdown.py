"""
The deliberate node-shutdown sequence (design doc), the
`[D]rain` sequence (design doc §13.8) that borrows its session-
management shape without actually ending the node process, and
`NodeControls`, the bundle an in-session SysOp command needs to trigger
either (design doc -- node management).

Split out of `netbbs.__main__` into its own module for the same reason
`netbbs.net.session_registry`/`netbbs.net.maintenance` were themselves
split out: this is shared, not entry-point-specific.
Originally only the signal handler in `__main__.py` called this; the
in-session `[N]ode` admin menu (`netbbs.net.admin_flow`) now does too,
so it needed a home outside the top-level process-bootstrap module.

`SequenceScheduler` (design doc -- node management, Thiesi's own
dogfood-testing report) fixes a real bug the original single-shot
`asyncio.create_task(run_drain_sequence(...))`/`run_shutdown_sequence(
...)` calls had: nothing tracked "is one of these already scheduled",
so a SysOp running `[D]rain` (or `[S]hutdown`) twice launched two
independent, uncoordinated sequences racing each other -- a second,
shorter delay could disconnect everyone, and a reconnecting user would
then wait out whatever remained of the *first* delay too, with zero
visibility into any of it. One `SequenceScheduler` per sequence kind
(drain, shutdown -- `netbbs.__main__` constructs both, alongside
`session_registry`/`maintenance`) now tracks at most one in-flight
sequence: scheduling a new one always cancels-and-replaces any
existing one first, and its tracked deadline/message is exactly what
lets a SysOp re-running the command explicitly choose to cancel
instead, what `netbbs.net.login_flow` reads to warn an already-
connecting or freshly-logged-in user, and what a live session's own
main-menu prompt reads to show a visual indicator.

    ActiveSessionRegistry`), then (a *graceful* request only) gives them

    stop() -> db.close()` sequence only ever runs once every session is
    already gone.

    `delay_seconds` (design doc -- node management): now a genuine
    per-invocation choice, the same shape `run_drain_sequence`'s own
    `delay_seconds` already had -- unifies the two commands' UX (Thiesi's
    own request) rather than shutdown alone being pinned to a fixed
    config default with no override. Ignored entirely when `graceful`
    is `False` -- an immediate shutdown has no countdown to schedule at
    any length.

    `message`, if given, *replaces* the default "going down in N
    seconds"/"going down now" text entirely rather than appending to it
    (design doc -- node management, Thiesi's own wording) —
    sanitized, since it's free text a SysOp typed, same discipline as
    anything else reaching the terminal. Broadcast verbatim at every
    stage of a graceful countdown (see `_run_staged_countdown`'s own
    docstring), not just the first.

    Cancellable while graceful and still counting down (design doc --
    node management): if the caller's own task is cancelled before the
    countdown finishes (a SysOp cancelling a scheduled shutdown via
    `SequenceScheduler`), `maintenance.deactivate()` reopens new-login
    admission before re-raising -- a cancelled shutdown must not leave
    the node silently unreachable forever. Once the countdown finishes
    normally and `disconnect_all()` is reached, there is no more turning
    back, matching `MaintenanceMode.activate()`'s own documented "no way
    back" claim from that point onward.

    Callers triggering this from *within* a live session (the admin
    menu) must not `await` it inline from that session's own call
    stack: the calling session's own task is one of the ones
    `disconnect_all()` cancels, and a task cancelling itself while
    awaiting a `gather()` that includes itself is the same species of
    hazard already hit and fixed elsewhere
    (`netbbs.net.chat_flow._chat_loop`). Fire this as an independent
    background task (`asyncio.create_task`) instead, exactly as the
    signal-handler path in `netbbs.__main__` already does — the calling

    already connected also needs to go), not silently implied by each
