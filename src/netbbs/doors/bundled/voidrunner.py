Voidrunner -- a persistent single-player space trading/exploration door
for NetBBS (issue #172 vertical: door-managed private save).

Same v1 door contract as `netbbs.doors.bundled.retro_trivia`: reads the
drop-file NetBBS hands it via `NETBBS_DOOR_INFO` for handle/user_id/color
depth, then owns raw stdin/stdout for the whole session (single keystroke
reads; this module adds its own small raw line-reader on top, for
numeric quantities and the callsign prompt, since NetBBS gives a door no
line-editing help). Runnable completely standalone outside NetBBS too.
Zero external dependencies -- stdlib only.

**Persistence**: NetBBS's door sandbox gives a door no database access
and deletes its scratch working directory after every session (see
`netbbs.doors.runtime`'s own docstring) -- a door manages any save data
entirely itself. This door keeps one JSON save file per caller, keyed by
the drop-file's stable numeric `user_id` (never the handle, which can
change), under `VOIDRUNNER_SAVE_DIR` if set, else `~/.netbbs/
voidrunner_saves/`. State is written after every state-changing action
(atomically, via a temp file + `os.replace`), not just on explicit quit
-- a door can be killed at any moment (caller disconnect, wall-clock
timeout) with no graceful-shutdown guarantee, so "save on quit only"
would lose real progress.

The default save location is deliberately *not* relative to this
script's own path: this module now ships as real installed package data
(`netbbs.doors.bundled`, resolved via `importlib.resources` -- see
`netbbs.doors.bundled.resolve_bundled_door_path`), and an installed
package's own directory is routinely read-only and/or wiped clean on
every upgrade, neither of which a save file can tolerate. A production
node with an unusual layout should set `VOIDRUNNER_SAVE_DIR` explicitly
rather than rely on the home-directory default holding for its own
service account.

**Architecture** (deliberate, for a reason beyond this door): the rules
of the game -- galaxy generation, pricing, combat resolution, mission
logic -- live in plain functions/dataclasses that only ever take a
`World` and return a new one plus narrative text (the "domain layer"
below); a small `load_or_create_save`/`write_save` pair is the only thing
that touches a filesystem path (the "storage layer"); everything that
touches `sys.stdin`/`sys.stdout` is confined to the "UI layer" at the
bottom. Today the storage layer is "read/write a local JSON file." If a
future NetBBS revision ever grows a mediated way for a door to talk to a
persistent background service (a real shared galaxy), *that* swap only
ever has to replace the storage layer -- the domain rules and the UI
loop are not coupled to "state lives in a local file." This does **not**
by itself make Voidrunner multiplayer, and nothing here assumes it ever
will be; it just avoids closing that door (see the design discussion in
issue #172 -- doors are locked as single-player/session-scoped in v1,
and this stays strictly inside that: one save, one player, no shared
state, no networking).

**Load-bearing invariant**: `generate_galaxy()` is a pure function of
the save's `seed` -- only the seed is persisted, not the galaxy itself,
to keep save files small. That only works if the *exact sequence* of
`random.Random` calls inside `generate_galaxy()` never changes; changing
call order/count for an existing release would silently regenerate a
different galaxy for every existing save (systems shifting id/name/
economy under a player's feet, `discovered` ids pointing at the wrong
system). Add new randomness only at the end of that function, never
threaded into the middle of its existing call sequence.
