"""
Decoding externally-authored ANSI art (design doc -- welcome banner
round): pure `bytes -> str` conversion, no I/O, matching this
package's existing boundary (nothing else in `netbbs.rendering` touches
`Database` or the filesystem).

`decode_ansi_bytes`'s output is trusted, SysOp-authored content, at the
same trust tier as `netbbs.rendering.ansi.colored()` output -- it is
meant to bypass `netbbs.rendering.sanitize.sanitize_text` entirely, not
pass through it. `sanitize_text` strips every Unicode "Control"
category character, including ESC (U+001B), which is exactly what real
ANSI art needs to keep (cursor positioning, SGR color codes). Do not
route this content through `sanitize_text` -- doing so would silently
strip every escape sequence and destroy the art.

    values -- every byte decodes to *some* code point, it never raises
    -- so once the fallback is reached, this function cannot fail. A
    genuine scene `.ans` file will almost always fail strict UTF-8
    decoding (its high-bit bytes rarely form valid UTF-8 sequences by
    chance), making the try/fallback a reliable, deterministic
    heuristic; a SysOp who directly authors valid UTF-8/Unicode content
    gets that path instead, automatically.
