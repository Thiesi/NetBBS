"""The Voidrunner suite's shared support: the door module, and the worlds.

The door is loaded from its file path under a private module name rather than
through `netbbs.doors.bundled` -- same reasoning as `test_doors_runtime.py`
running it and `retro_trivia.py` this same way: this is the exact file NetBBS
launches as a standalone subprocess (see `netbbs.doors.runtime`), not an
ordinarily-imported library module, so testing it by path exercises precisely
what ships. It is loaded once here and shared by every module in this package
(issue #422); `test_backup.py` reaches the same file through the package, which
is a second load under a second name and is deliberate -- that test is about the
installed package, this suite is about the shipped script.
